## pyHIDS


### Presentation

[pyHIDS](https://github.com/cedricbonhomme/pyHIDS) is a
[HIDS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host-based_intrusion_detection_system)
(host-based intrusion detection system) for verifying the integrity of a system.
It uses an RSA signature to check the integrity of its database.
Alerts are written in the logs of the system and can be sent via email
to a list of users. You can define rules to specify files to be checked
periodically.

It is recommended to use Python >= 3.11.

### Features

* checks the integrity of system's files with a list of rules;
* checks the output of commands (*iptables*, ...);
* uses an RSA signature to check the integrity of its database;
* alerts are written in the logs of the system;
* alerts can be sent via email to a list of users;
* alerts can be sent on IRC channels through the
  [irker](https://gitlab.com/esr/irker) IRC client (which should be running as a
  daemon).


### Configuration

The configuration is really easy. First get pyHIDS source code and copy the
sample configuration file:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/cedricbonhomme/pyHIDS.git
$ cd pyHIDS/
$ cp ./conf.cfg-sample ./conf.cfg
$ poetry install
```

Then edit the file **conf.cfg**:

```ini
[globals]
nb_bits = 2048
[irc]
channel = irc://chat.freenode.net/#testpyHIDS
host = localhost
port = 6659
[email]
enabled = 0
mail_from = pyHIDS@no-reply.com
mail_to = you_address
smtp = SMTP_server
username = your_username
password = your_password
[files]
file1 = /etc/crontab
file2 = /boot/grub/grub.cfg
file3 = /etc/shadow
file4 = /etc/networks
[rules]
rule1 = conf$ /etc
rule2 = list /etc/apt
rule3 = .* /bin
[commands]
iptables = /sbin/iptables -L
```


Description of the sections:

* *globals*: set the number of bits of the RSA keys;
* *irc*: configure notifications sent via IRC;
* *email*: configure the email notifications. Set the value of "enabled" to 1
  to activate notifications;
* *files*: list of files to scan;
* *rules*: regular expression to specify files in a folder;
* *commands*: command's output to check.


### Example of use


```bash
$ pyhids-genKeys
Generating 2048 bits RSA keys ...
Dumping Keys
Done.

$ pyhids-genBase
Generating database...
543 files in the database.

$ pyhids-run
```

Modify a character in the file  **/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf** and relaunch the
program:

```bash
$ pyhids-run
[01/03/13 15:05:31] [warning] /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf changed.
```

The program warns that the file has changed. When this happens, a warning is
generated in the logs **/var/log/syslog** and a mail is sent to the
administrator.
If no change is detected only the log file is updated.


### Automatic execution

Use the time-based job scheduler, Cron, in order to schedule system scans.
In your shell enter the command:

```bash
$ crontab -e
```

And add the following line to check the integrity of the system every fifty
minutes:

```bash
*/50 * * * * pyhids-run
```

After each system check, pyHIDS sends a report to the administrators.
In the case of an attacker who has deleted the cron line, for example.
